Memecoin Scout

Memecoin Scout is a real-time scanner for newly launched Solana tokens.
It monitors fresh pairs, applies configurable risk filters, scores momentum, and surfaces high-signal candidates through a lightweight dashboard.

The project is designed as a foundation for research, monitoring, and experimentation with live market data, and can be extended toward automated or semi-automated trading strategies.

Key Capabilities

➡ Real-time scanning of new Solana pairs via DexScreener
➡ Risk filtering to remove obvious rugs and low-liquidity tokens
➡ Scoring engine combining liquidity, volume, age, holders, and momentum signals
➡ Momentum detection for volume and price spikes
➡ SQLite persistence for historical tracking and analysis
➡ Streamlit dashboard for live exploration and filtering
➡ Optional Telegram alerts for higher-scoring candidates
➡ Modular architecture designed for extensibility (auto-trading, multi-chain support)

Tech Stack

➡ Python 3.11+
➡ Asyncio for concurrent scanning
➡ Streamlit for the dashboard UI
➡ SQLite for lightweight persistence
➡ Pandas for data handling
➡ DexScreener API
➡ Telegram Bot API (optional alerts)

How It Works

High-level flow:

DexScreener → Filters → Scorer → SQLite → Dashboard / Alerts


➡ The scanner continuously polls DexScreener for new Solana pairs
➡ Tokens are filtered using minimum risk criteria (liquidity, holders, age, etc.)
➡ Remaining tokens are scored on a 0–1 scale using momentum and risk metrics
➡ Results are stored in SQLite for analysis and visualization
➡ The dashboard reads from the database and displays live results
➡ Optional Telegram alerts trigger for higher-scoring tokens

Quick Start
Clone and Set Up
git clone https://github.com/JASecurity/memecoin_scout
cd memecoin_scout
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration

Edit config.yaml to match your setup and risk tolerance:

min_liq_usd: 5000
min_vol_5m_usd: 2000
min_score_to_trade: 0.75

telegram_token: "your_bot_token"
telegram_chat_id: "your_chat_id"

paper_mode: true


➡ You can tighten or relax these thresholds depending on how early or conservative you want to be.

Running the Bot and Dashboard

Open the project in VS Code and use two terminals:

Terminal 1 – Start the Scanner
cd "C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Downloads\memecoin_scout\memecoin_scout"
$env:PYTHONPATH="."
python app/main.py --live

Terminal 2 – Start the Dashboard
cd "C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Downloads\memecoin_scout\memecoin_scout"
& ".venv\Scripts\python.exe" -m streamlit run dashboard.py

Access the Dashboard

➡ Streamlit will output a local URL, typically:

http://localhost:8501


➡ Open this in your browser to view the dashboard.

Dashboard Overview

➡ Live table of recently scanned tokens
➡ Token scores and key metrics
➡ Filters for liquidity, volume, age, and score
➡ Focused views on higher-scoring or flagged tokens
➡ Lightweight historical view backed by SQLite

The scanner and dashboard can run continuously to monitor new launches as they appear.

Troubleshooting
“No new tokens found”

➡ Normal during quieter periods
➡ Leave the scanner running
➡ Loosen thresholds in config.yaml if needed

Dashboard does not start

➡ Confirm Streamlit is installed: pip install streamlit
➡ Ensure the virtual environment is activated
➡ Check that port 8501 is free
➡ Confirm you are in the project root directory

Import or module errors

➡ Ensure PYTHONPATH is set
➡ Use Python from .venv
➡ Reinstall dependencies if needed: pip install -r requirements.txt

Roadmap

Planned or potential extensions:

➡ Live trading integration (e.g., Jupiter DEX)
➡ Smarter token classification with richer feature sets
➡ Multi-chain support (Base, Ethereum, BSC, etc.)
➡ Backtesting using SQLite history
➡ Additional alert channels (Discord, Webhooks)
➡ More advanced risk and position-sizing logic

Why This Project Matters

➡ End-to-end system design (async ingestion → storage → UI)
➡ Practical risk filtering in noisy, adversarial markets
➡ Operational discipline around configuration and environments
➡ Use of real live market data instead of static examples
